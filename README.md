# RPH.jl

Randomized Progressive Hedging.

## Example

See script `example.jl`.

## Questions

- State of problem structure
- What stopping criterion ?
- What initialization for x: 0, subpbs solutions ?
- Interfaces with JuMP world packages : StructJuMP ?

## TODOs

- [ ] For fair comparison with RPH, make PH subpb computation also distributed.
- [ ] Clean up code, stick to paper notations
